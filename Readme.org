* üí¶ Liquid Address
** üìñ About
This is a concept of a *non-custodial Lightning Address* provider that directs incoming payments to a predefined *Liquid* address.

It can function independently as a standalone service or
serve as a backup for other Lightning address providers.
This is particularly useful for services directing incoming payments
to mobile nodes that may not always be online.

** üîß How It Works
The service operates as a Lightning Address provider, following these steps when a request for an invoice is received:

1. the service initiates a swap on the exchange
2. it sends the invoice to the payer, who begins the payment process
3. the service awaits the appearance of the swap transaction in the mempool
4. upon detecting the transaction, it signs and broadcasts a claim transaction
5. the exchange detects the claim transaction, settles the invoice
6. the payer observes the successful completion of the payment

All *trustless* and within a *matter of seconds* due to the use of zero-conf swaps
(refer to security considerations below).

*** Fees
The exchange charges a *0.25%* fee for the service,
plus approximately *500 sats* in on-chain fees.

*** Limits
The exchange imposes limits on the minimum and maximum amounts that can be swapped.
Currently, the range is set at *1,000‚Äì25,000,000 sats* (0.50‚Äì12,000.00 EUR).

** üîê Security Model
*** Liquid Address
During a swap, the service determines the Liquid address to swap to.
While it has the potential to replace the user's address with its own,
the impact is minimal as the service can always return an invoice to its own node.

*** Zero-conf
The service employs a zero-conf swap, meaning that once the swap transaction
enters the mempool,
it promptly signs and broadcasts a claiming transaction.
While this opens up the possibility of the exchange attempting a double spend,
the service can counteract this by providing proof of the initial swap transaction,
what would result in significant reputational damage for the exchange.

Although it is feasible to wait for one confirmation before broadcasting
the claim transaction, doing so would introduce additional delays
(up to one minute).
Additionally, there is the flexibility to choose between a zero-conf swap
or not based on the payment amount.
